# VThere Spatial Experience Builder - Session Handoff

## Objective / topic

`Wk2_Persistence_Loading_of_Json`: make project persistence understandable and usable in the browser, add verified JSON file import, provide a local read-only runtime simulation, and establish a searchable approved asset catalog.

## Decisions made and why

- Browser `localStorage` remains a local draft mechanism only; it is not durable multi-user persistence.
- The editor exposes both `Load draft` for browser storage and `Import JSON` for a user-selected `.json` file.
- Imported files are validated before replacing the current project. Invalid imports leave the current project unchanged.
- Validation rejects malformed JSON, unsupported schema versions, wrong file types, files over 2 MB, invalid project/scene/object structure, non-finite transforms, duplicate IDs, overlong labels, more than 100 scenes, or more than 5,000 objects.
- Automatic corruption repair is intentionally not implemented. Silent guessing could destroy valid data; future recovery should produce a report or preview instead.
- The first save writes both the primary local draft and backup. Existing draft recovery tries primary, then backup, then a clean project.
- The runtime work is a local read-only simulation using the same current `ProjectData` and Three.js viewport. It is not a published URL or separate `apps/runtime` application yet.
- Asset management starts with a data-driven approved catalog and search. Arbitrary upload, conversion, remote storage, thumbnails, and missing-asset recovery remain deferred until their contracts are approved.

## Current skeleton / plan state

- Phase plan: `docs/07-research-and-history/2026-09-07--HISTORY--week2-runtime-persistence-plan.md`.
- Implemented runtime preview controls: `Run simulation`, visitor-style simulation screen, `Exit simulation`, and non-interactive viewport mode.
- Implemented persistence clarity: `Load draft`, visible localStorage status, save/autosave status, backup status, and JSON export.
- Implemented JSON import: browser file picker, import status/error reporting, strict validation, and no state replacement on rejection.
- Implemented asset foundation: `src/assets.ts` owns asset metadata and filtering; the asset panel has searchable approved assets and match counts.
- Implemented viewport resource cleanup so scene objects are not recreated and GPU resources are not leaked every animation frame.
- Architecture remains intentionally unchanged. The root `src/` editor is still the current implementation surface; `apps/runtime` remains a placeholder and backend/API publishing is not wired.

## Build / verify command and status

Run from `VThere Spatial Experience Builder/`:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd test
npm.cmd run dev
```

Required browser golden path:

1. Add an asset and save the project.
2. Reload the page and use `Load draft`.
3. Export JSON.
4. Import the exported JSON through the browser file picker.
5. Try a malformed, oversized, wrong-extension, or structurally invalid JSON file and confirm the current project remains unchanged.
6. Search the asset catalog.
7. Run simulation, confirm editor controls are absent, then exit simulation.

Current verification status: VS Code diagnostics report no errors in the touched TypeScript/CSS files. In the current shell, `npm.cmd`, Node.js, and Git were not resolvable, so build, test, browser, and Git diff checks were not run in this handoff session. Do not mark the browser acceptance item complete until those commands run successfully.

## Files touched for this topic

- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/serializer.ts`
- `src/assets.ts`
- `src/Viewport.tsx`
- `src/RuntimeView.tsx`
- `src/styles.css`
- `docs/07-research-and-history/2026-09-07--HISTORY--week2-runtime-persistence-plan.md`
- `SESSION.md`

## Failed approaches already tried

- Treating `localStorage` as the only project-loading mechanism was insufficient because it cannot load a JSON file from another browser or machine.
- Accepting any parsed object with `schemaVersion === 1` was insufficient because malformed structure, duplicate IDs, invalid transforms, and excessive resource counts could pass through.
- Automatic corruption repair was rejected as unsafe. The current behavior rejects and preserves the active project instead.
- A full build/test/browser run was attempted but blocked because Node/npm was unavailable in the current PowerShell PATH.
- A Git diff check was attempted but Git was unavailable in the current PowerShell PATH.

## Open questions

- Should imported JSON be autosaved immediately, or require an explicit confirmation before replacing the local draft?
- Should import support a preview/diff screen before commit?
- What exact asset metadata is required: thumbnail URL, GLB URL, license, scale, pivot, category, and performance budget?
- Should missing assets block loading, show placeholders, or produce a repair report?
- When should persistence move from browser storage to the FastAPI/PostgreSQL/object-storage path?
- When should the local simulation become the separate `apps/runtime` application boundary?
- What visitor interactions, navigation model, and analytics events must the runtime support?

## Next recommended step

Make Node.js/npm available and run the build, tests, and browser golden path. Then add focused serializer tests for valid import, malformed JSON, wrong schema, duplicate IDs, invalid transforms, size limits, and preservation of the current project after rejection. After that, define the asset metadata contract and implement missing-asset validation before adding arbitrary upload or remote storage.
